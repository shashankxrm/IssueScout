<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--<img src="public/dashboard.png" /> -->

IssueScout surfaces beginner-friendly GitHub issues across multiple repositories, empowering first-time contributors to dive into open source. It helps:

- 🔎 **Identify low-hanging issues** by language, labels, or difficulty  
- 📄 **View clear, actionable issue details** and contribution tips  
- 🚀 **Quick-start contribution**, with direct links and usage guidance

### Built With

* NextJS
* TailwindCSS
* OAuth
* TypeScript
* ShadCN
* MongoDB
* ReactIcons




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy follow these simple example steps.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Use Cases

### 👶 First-Time Contributors  
> Discover beginner-friendly GitHub issues and avoid the overwhelm of navigating large repositories.

- Find issues labeled `good first issue`, `beginner`, `easy`, etc.  
- Understand contribution steps clearly before diving in.

### 👨‍💻 Open Source Enthusiasts  
> Quickly scan and filter for open issues across multiple repositories in your favorite language or domain.

- Contribute to trending repositories in React, Node.js, Python, etc.  
- Build a consistent contribution graph with focused issue tracking.

### 🎓 Students & Hackathon Teams  
> Kickstart open source contributions for resumes, hackathons, or college programs like GSoC.

- Easily pick meaningful issues to work on as a team.  
- Learn collaboration through GitHub workflows and pull requests.

### 👩‍🏫 Educators & Mentors  
> Recommend real issues to students learning Git, GitHub, and open source contributions.

- Curate issues by domain to assign as practice problems.  
- Showcase how to contribute effectively.

### 📈 Portfolio Builders  
> Boost your GitHub profile by solving open issues and linking them in your resume or portfolio.

- Find contribution-ready tasks without repo-hunting.  
- Build confidence and consistency in OSS involvement.


<!-- TESTING 
## Testing (Undergoing changes)

ForkSpy has a comprehensive test suite using Playwright for end-to-end testing. Tests cover:

* Authentication flows
* Dashboard functionality
* Repository management
* Error handling

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the tests
npx playwright test
```

### CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

**CI Pipeline** (runs on every PR and push):
- ✅ ESLint checking
- ✅ TypeScript type checking  
- ✅ Test suite with coverage
- ✅ Build verification
- ✅ Security audit

**CD Pipeline** (runs on main branch):
- 🚀 Automatic deployment to Vercel

The pipeline ensures code quality and automates deployment. Check the "Actions" tab for detailed build logs.

## Deployment

For deployment setup and configuration, see our [Deployment Guide](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Quick Setup
1. Configure required secrets in GitHub repository settings
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Push to `main` branch for automatic deployment

Required secrets:
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` - For Vercel deployment
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - For authentication
- `MONGODB_URI` - Database connection
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Code coverage (optional)
