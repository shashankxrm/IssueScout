<!-- TESTING 
## Testing (Undergoing changes)

ForkSpy has a comprehensive test suite using Playwright for end-to-end testing. Tests cover:

* Authentication flows
* Dashboard functionality
* Repository management
* Error handling

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the tests
npx playwright test
```

### CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Every pull request and push to the main branch triggers:

1. Application build
2. Automated test runs across multiple browsers
3. Test report generation

The test badge at the top of this README shows the current test status for the main branch.

To see detailed test reports, check the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository.
